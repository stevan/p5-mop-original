=head1 NAME

Perl 5 MOP - Meta Object Protocol - Class Sub Protocol

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document will describe the proposed API for the
class sub-protocol of the MOP.

=head2 API

As you will see, we are leaning on the side of immutability
here, and only allowing the class to be changed in certain
specific ways. This may be losened up over time, but we
feel it is a good starting point.

B<AUTHORS NOTE:> This is by no means a comprehensive
list, nor is it a fixed list, of methods. This is simply
the first draft of this, and a rough one at that.

=head3 General

These methods are simply accessors for specific metadata
about a class.

=over 4

=item C<get_name>

This returns the class name as a string.

=item C<get_version>

This returns the class version as a value (type of value is TBD).

=item C<get_authority>

This returns the class authority as a string.

=item C<is_subclass_of( $class )>

This is simply a predicate to determine if a given C<$class> is
in the MRO of this class.

=item C<clone( %params )>

Clone this object and override any internal elements using
the values in C<%params>.

=back

=head3 Events

Right now we only have two events defined, but it is possible
that we will make more.

=over 4

=item C<FINALIZE>

Once a class has been completely constructed, this event method
is called.

=item C<CREATE ( \%params )>

When a class must construct an instance, this method is called.
The default action is to loop through all the attributes in the
MRO and add slots to the instance accordingly and fill them with
either the intial value, or a value from the C<%params>.

=back

=head3 Superclasses

These methods provide access to the superclass list, as
well as the compiled method resolution order of a class.

=over 4

=item C<get_superclasses>

This returns an array reference which contains the superclasses
for this given class.

=item C<add_superclasses( \@superclasses )>

This accepts an array reference of class objects which will be
pushed onto the end of the superclass list.

=item C<get_mro>

This traverses the inheritance hierarchy to gather up all the
classes in the same order in which method resolution would happen.

=back

=head3 Constructor/Destructor

We propose that constructors and destructors be implemented
as methods, but not be available through the normal method
dispatch. The following methods provide access to those items.

=over 4

=item C<get_constructor>

This returns the method object used for constructing the object.

=item C<set_constructor( $method )>

Given a C<$method>, this sets it to the value of the constructor.

=item C<get_destructor>

This returns the method object used for destructing the object.

=item C<set_destructor( $method )>

Given a C<$method>, this sets it to the value of the destructor.

=back

=head3 Attributes

=over 4

=item C<attribute_class>

This is the default attribute class that should be used in making
any new attributes for this class.

=item C<get_attributes>

This returns the set of attributes for this given class.

=item C<add_attribute( $attribute )>

This will add an C<$attribute> object to the set of attributes
in this class.

=back

=head3 Methods

=over 4

=item C<method_class>

This is the default method class that should be used in making any
new method for this class.

=item C<get_methods>

This returns the set of method for this given class.

=item C<add_method( $method )>

This will add an C<$method> object to the set of methods in this
class.

=item C<find_method( $name )>

Given a C<$name>, this will attempt to locate a method by that name
within the MRO of the class.
