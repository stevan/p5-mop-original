# A MOP for Perl 5

This repository contains an ever evolving proposal and a
functioning prototype for a Meta Object Protocol, or MOP,
to be perhaps included in a future version of Perl 5.

The core goal is to provide a simple, lightweight and
highly Perl-ish MOP that will provide the same degree of
flexibility and TIMTOWTDI of the original Perl 5 object
model, but with more a formalized class model.

This proposal will be developed in the open and comments
are welcome.

-----------------------------
Prototype notes ...
-----------------------------

This is a prototype of the proposed MOP for Perl 5. The
main purpose of this prototypes is to work out a few
of key things; the syntax/semantics of the object
system, the underlying MOP API and the extensibility
of the MOP itself.

Ideally this will also provide the starts of a test
suite that can be ported to the final implementation.

This prototype, for the most part, accurately
reflects the proposed syntax/semanitics of the object
system, however the implementation is another story.
Basically, any implementation found in these folders
should *NEVER* be considered a proposal for a *specific*
implementation technique. In fact, much of what you might
find in here will likely use scary and tricky techniques
to accomplish desired behaviors, and it would be
expected that a real implementation would *NOT* use
such scary and tricky techniques.
